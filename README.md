# Dice

This is a modern, minimilistic, mobile friendly dice rolling web application.

I enjoy a game of D&D every once in a while but not enough to have gone out and purchased my own dice. I often end up using web based dice rollers but more times than not, they're clunky, ugly, ad ridden or overly comlicated for just wanting to roll a d20. So I came up with a stylish, easy to use, web based dice roller that's mobile friendly so u never have to worry about forgetting your dice again.
